# uwuify-rustAPI
My (very primitive) attempt at using [uwu](https://github.com/Daniel-Liu-c0deb0t/uwu) by [Daniel-Liu-c0deb0t](https://github.com/Daniel-Liu-c0deb0t) in rust to get uwuified output when quering a str, as a GET request
used for https://uwupedia.org/


this took way longer than it should've

Usage:

run `cargo run` in the root directory of this project 
now you can send simple requests to 127.0.0.1:3030/uwu/your text to be uwufied
(questionmark will stop processing of remainder of str (I dont know rust good enough))

this will return plain text
